1) 3, from the three minima in the position
   separation
2) The velocity difference peaks when the position
   difference is minimized.
3) The merger occurs at ~6.1 Gyr, and M33's orbit
   begins to stabilize, keeping a roughly constant
   position pattern and a roughly constant velocity
   pattern, though it is shrinking slowly over time.
4) The decay rate seems to be ~1 kpc/Gyr, so M33 would
   take 75 Gyr to merge with the merged Milky Way-M31 galaxy
   (Milkdromeda?, The Andromeda Way?) That's a really long
   time!
