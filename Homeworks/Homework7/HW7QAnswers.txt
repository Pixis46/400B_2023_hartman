1) See HW7Figures
2) The plots are similar at early times, but diverge
   significantly as the time gets larger
3) The missing physics could be the lack of the Milky Way's
   gravitational presence, as well as the affects of tidal
   interactions.
4) I would include the MW by performing similar computations
   to the M31 potential to get the MW potential using the relative
   distance from the MW to M33. Then it is the same process to
   compute the acceleration induced by the MW. Then add that to the
   acceleration with M31.
