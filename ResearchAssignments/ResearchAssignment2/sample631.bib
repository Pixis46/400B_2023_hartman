    abstract = "{We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efficient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We find, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (〈c/a〉∼ 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional ‘adiabatic-contraction’ hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile ΛCDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's detailed assembly history.}",

    abstract = "{Several lines of evidence suggest that as dark matter haloes grow their scale radius increases, and that the density in their central region drops. Major mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain both these phenomena, and the resulting patterns in the concentration–mass–redshift relation. To test this possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety of cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The remnants typically have higher densities than the initial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions. They are reasonably well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from those of the initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant, relative to the internal energy of the initial conditions, κ, has the greatest influence on the properties of the final mass distribution. As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, increasing in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10–20 per cent), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger. We conclude that while major mergers can produce remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively ineffective at changing the central densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to explain the mean trends in the concentration–mass–redshift relation.}",
