    abstract = "{We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efficient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We find, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (〈c/a〉∼ 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional ‘adiabatic-contraction’ hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile ΛCDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's detailed assembly history.}",

    abstract = "{We analyse the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disc galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio ≥ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their z = 0 stellar mass (\\$10^\\{10.5-11.2\\}\\, \\rm \\{M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$), discy stellar morphology and local environment. First, major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31 galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disc is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar discs. In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar discs, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8–11 and  2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively thin stellar disc at z = 0.}",
